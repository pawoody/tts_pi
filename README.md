Text-to-speech:


I was reading a good book recently at the recommendation of a friend and I didn't want to put it down. At the same time, my head was killing me. I checked the audio version (auto-generated) and it was pretty terrible, so I figured I would play around with creating my own.

Using [this](https://github.com/pawoody/tts_pi/blob/main/Text_to_speech_example.ipynb) notebook, you can do the same!
